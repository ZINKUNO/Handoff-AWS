"""The two levers a spoken turn needs that a typed one does not.

Typed chat shows a config and a "Save and switch on" button; the person
clicks. Spoken chat has no button, so the assistant has to do the saving
and the starting itself — and the page has to find out. Both tools emit an
event on the chat's channel (``workflow_saved``, ``run_started``) so the orb
page can draw the workspace card and follow the run without polling.

The channel comes from a context variable set for the duration of a turn,
because a Strands tool is called by the agent loop with only its declared
arguments; there is no other clean way to hand it the page it belongs to.
