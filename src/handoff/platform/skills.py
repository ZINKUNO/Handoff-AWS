"""Reusable instruction, written once and attached where it's needed.

A skill is markdown with a name and a description. The description is the
part that does the work: an agent reads it to decide whether the body is
worth loading, which is how you can have twenty skills without putting twenty
pages into every prompt.

Handoff uses them for the judgement that differs between workspaces — what
counts as urgent in *your* inbox, which senders are internal, what your team
means by "blocked". That knowledge doesn't belong in the executor's prompt,
because it isn't true for everyone.
