"""MCP server registry.

Handoff's tools are MCP servers rather than hard-coded API clients, which is
what lets a workflow the Builder wrote on one machine run on another with a
different set of integrations. Adding Notion support should be a registry
entry and a credential, not a code change in the executor.

Connections are opened lazily and cached for the life of the process; an MCP
stdio server costs a subprocess, so a run that touches Gmail three times should
not spawn three of them.
