"""Running a workflow, pausing it on a human decision, and picking it back up.

The interesting property here is that a paused run is not a special state
machine Handoff maintains — it is a Strands Graph with its state serialised.
``start()`` returns when the graph either finishes or raises interrupts;
``resume()`` rehydrates the same graph and feeds the human's answers back into
the tool call that was waiting for them. The agent's reasoning context survives
the gap, however long it is.
