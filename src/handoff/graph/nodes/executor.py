"""Executor node tools — how the workflow reaches the outside world.

Every function here has two bodies: a synthetic one for the demo and the test
suite, and a real one that routes through an MCP server. The switch is
``USE_MOCK_TOOLS``; the tool signature the model sees is identical either way,
which is the point of putting MCP behind the tool boundary.
