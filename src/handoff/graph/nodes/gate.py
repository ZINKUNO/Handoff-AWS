"""The gated action tool.

``submit_action`` is the only tool in the executor that changes anything in the
outside world, which is what makes it the right chokepoint for the human gate.
The gating itself lives in ``handoff.graph.hooks.hitl`` — by the time this
function body runs, either the agent was confident enough to proceed or a human
has already chosen the action it is about to take.
